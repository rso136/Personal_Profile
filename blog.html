            <p>When the call came, I almost couldn't believe it. Finally. After months and months of applications, sending out resumes, speaking with tech recruiters, and nervous waiting, I got it. I was hired. Just a few moments before, I had sat dejected on the floor of my bedroom, in prayer and in tears. Nearly half a year had gone by since I graduated from my web development bootcamp and jobwise, nothing was working out. As a result, I had been seriously discussing with my wife the prospect of cutting my losses and simply moving on to something else. But now, "Finally", I thought, "Finally, I am turning the page to a new chapter. Finally." I sighed in relief and in anticipation for what was coming.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Nearly a month later, I sat hunched over my desk at work, staring through blurry eyes at hundreds of lines of code on my computer screen. My stomach was turning nauseously and I found myself struggling to catch my breath. As the nausea worsened my co-worker noticed me curled over my keyboard, with my head in my hands, breathing heavily, and with immediate concern, helped me over to a couch in the office. "Are you stressed? You're too hard on yourself. Take it easy!" Truth be told, I was immensely stressed though I was certain that my sudden ailment was more than just tension from work. The weeks leading up to that point were really contrary to what I imagined a month ago when I received the call. I certainly expected hardships and challenges associated with picking up a new job in a entirely new career field. I did not expect that I would be plunged into years worth of accumulated technical problems from day one on the job and I did not expect that I would be expected to fix it all on my own with little to no support or guidance. </p>
